THERE ARE 4 MAIN FOLDERS :==
src/ - contains main file for testing
impl/ - actual implementation for "number" (is a library and needs Forward Declartion and linking to be used)
include/ - contains header files (which contains Forward Declartions)
alloc/ - has some faster(i think) way to allocating memory (also a library but is only linked to impl's library not src's executable)
